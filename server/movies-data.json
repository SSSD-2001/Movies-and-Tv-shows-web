This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and takes viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien's pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of NÃºmenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.",
